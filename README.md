###OBJECT:
         The objective of this program is to create a student grade tracker that allows users to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with any additional information such as letter grade or GPA.
###KEY ACTIVITIES:
                Create a Student class to store student information and grades.
                Implement methods to add grades, calculate the average grade, and get letter grade and GPA.
Create a main function to interact with the user and display grades.
  ###TECNOLOGY USED:
                   Python programming language: The program is written in Python, a high-level, interpreted programming language.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The program uses OOP concepts such as classes and objects to organize and structure the code.
Input/Output Operations: The program uses Python's built-in input() function to read user input and print() function to display output.
Conditional Statements: The program uses Python's if-elif-else statements to implement the logic for calculating letter grade and GPA.
